## Introduction

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) are crucial for ensuring workplace safety and compliance in industrial tasks. This project outlines the development of an AI-powered chatbot that assists employees by providing relevant SOPs and PPE recommendations based on the description of the tasks they perform. The chatbot is built using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) model, to accurately classify tasks and deliver precise instructions.

## Business Use Case

In an industrial setting, ensuring that employees have quick and easy access to SOPs and PPE guidelines is vital. This chatbot addresses this need by offering a robust, AI-powered solution that:

-   Enhances operational safety by providing accurate and timely SOPs and PPE recommendations.
-   Increases efficiency by automating the retrieval of task-specific safety information.
-   Reduces the risk of human error by ensuring that employees always follow the correct procedures.

### Step 1: Loading and Inspecting Data

We begin by loading the dataset that contains task descriptions, SOPs, and PPEs. The data is then inspected to understand its structure and contents.

### Step 2: Preparing Data for BERT Model Training

To train the BERT model, we encode the task descriptions and split the data into training and testing sets. The data preparation process ensures that the model is capable of understanding and processing the nuances of task descriptions, leading to accurate classification.

### Step 3: Fine-Tuning the BERT Model

The BERT model is fine-tuned on the task-specific dataset, allowing it to adapt to the particularities of the tasks. This step involves multiple epochs of training to optimize the modelâ€™s performance.

### Step 4: Implementing the Chatbot

The chatbot is implemented using the fine-tuned BERT model. It processes natural language input from users, classifies the task, and retrieves the relevant SOPs and PPEs. The chatbot also provides step-by-step instructions for the SOPs if requested.

### Step 5: Running and Interacting with the Chatbot

The chatbot is designed to interact with users in real-time, offering guidance based on the task description provided. It ensures that employees are well-informed about the safety procedures and equipment required for their tasks.
